#RedisCache
The **RedisCache** extension is designed to act as a shim for MediaWiki's built in support for the *PHP Redis C library* extension.

This extension was inspired by the Redis implementation in [Extension:GettingStarted](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:GettingStarted) uses a small portion of GPL code from it.
